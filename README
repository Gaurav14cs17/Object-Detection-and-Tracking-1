Detect the face in the first frame of the movie: Using pre-trained Viola-Jones detector
Track the face throughout the movie using:
CAMShift
Particle Filter
Face detector + Kalman Filter (always run the kf.predict(), and run kf.correct() when you get a new face detection)
 
Face Detector + Optical Flow tracker (use the OF tracker whenever the face detector fails).
